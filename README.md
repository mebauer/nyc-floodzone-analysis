### New York City's Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map (PFIRM) Data Analysis

Author: Mark Bauer

I've wanted to do this project for some time now, and I'm finally happy to share this open source project. This notebook demonstrates how to analyze FEMA's Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map (i.e. PFIRM), sometimes known as *flood zone*. The flood zone is for New York City (i.e. all five boroughs). Let's see what cool things we can discover about this dataset!

Kindly find the analysis in the [floodzone_pfirm_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/nyc-floodzone-analysis/blob/master/floodzone_pfirm_analysis.ipynb) notebook.
