			<abstract>
The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting
data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance
flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM
Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data,
where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
The file is georeferenced to earth&apos;s surface using the State Plane projection and coordinate system. The
specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for
mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.
			</abstract>
			<purpose>
The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase
requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which &quot;... requires the purchase of flood insurance by
property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or
insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located
in identified areas having special flood hazards,&quot; Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the
FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP.
The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable
for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that
serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.

The hardcopy FIRM and DFIRM and the accompanying FISs are the official designation of SFHAs and
Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) for the NFIP.  For the purposes of the NFIP, changes to the flood risk
information published by FEMA may only be performed by FEMA and through the mechanisms established
in the NFIP regulations (44 CFR Parts 59-78).
These digital data are produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FIRMs and generally matches the
hardcopy map exactly.  However the hardcopy flood maps and flood profiles are the authoritative
documents for the NFIP.
Acknowledgement of FEMA would be appreciated in products derived from these data.

The DFIRM Database consists of countywide vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction
with the hard copy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and DFIRM maps are issued as the official
designation of the SFHAs. As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for
administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations
for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world
conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and
floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA&apos;s requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process
that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping
Partners.  Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and
a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system.
Independent quality control testing of FEMA&apos;s DFIRM database was also performed.
To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been
determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of
Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS report that accompanies this DFIRM database.
Users should be aware that BFEs shown in the S_BFE table represent rounded whole-foot elevations.
These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and should not be used as the sole source
of flood elevation information.  Accordingly, flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used
in conjunction with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management.  The 1-percent-annual-
chance water-surface elevations shown in the S_XS table match the regulatory elevations shown in
the FIS report.
			</attraccr>
		</attracc>
		<logic>
When FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at
the boundaries.  Likewise flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked
to ensure agreement at the confluence.  The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to
ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the
information shown on the FIRM.  However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM are rounded whole-foot
elevations.  They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match
the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.
		</logic>
		<complete>
Data contained in the DFIRM Database files reflect the content of the source materials.  Features may have
been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints.  With new
mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces.  However, older information is
often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place.
Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for
floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river
flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain
topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Both detailed and approximate analyses are
employed. Generally, detailed analyses are used to generate flood risk data only for developed or
developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA uses
approximate analyses to generate flood risk data. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one
square mile are studied.

						<othercit>The Digital Natural Color aerial imagery was acquired in July 2007. The Ground Control used to support the 4-band ortho-imagery production was collected by identifying strategic points on previous aerial photography and supplemented by selecting new points or photo identifiable points (PID) in areas where needed due to a lack or minimal existence of points from previous ortho-imagery production projects and then determining the precise location coordinates of the entire ground control network by using ground survey techniques. The new Ground Control Network was also supplemented by targeting existing New York State HARN stations data. The Digital Aerial Triangulation (DAT) was performed, primarily, using softcopy workstations and Intergraph&apos;s ISAT. DAT solutions were independently reviewed and checked using independent blind control points. Digital Elevation Models (DEM) (mass-points and break-lines) used to support ortho imagery production were supplied by the state and updated using standard photogrammetric collection techniques on Intergraph soft copy workstations. The images were then ortho-rectified using Sanborn&apos;s proprietary APS orthophoto software modules. Color balancing, seamless mosaicking was performed by automatic and manual seam line creation steps, final color balancing and final extractions were also accomplished using this software. A final tile by tile quality control was performed using Adobe PhotoShop software. The imagery product deliverables are GeoTIFF images with embedded header information describing the required projection, pixel size, tile size and other related data and corresponding world files (.tfw). Derivative compressed imagery is also available in JP2000 format.</othercit>

The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348) of 1982 established the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) which is comprised of coastal barrier units along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Great Lakes coasts.  These areas are depicted on a series of maps entitled John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System that are enacted by Congress.  Most new Federal expenditures and financial assistance (including flood insurance) are prohibited within the CBRS.

Since its inception in 1982, the CBRS has since been amended by several acts of Congress, including the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-591). With minor exception, only Congress, through new legislation, can modify the boundaries of the CBRS.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is responsible for maintaining the official maps of the CBRS, and facilitating changes enacted by Congress.

In cooperation with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FWS digitized the CBRS boundaries from the official CBRS source maps for this area and adjusted them to fit the digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  The process of fitting CBRS boundaries to the FIRM base map in some cases resulted in a slightly different configuration of the line as shown on the Congressionally-adopted source maps.  The CBRS boundaries depicted on this FIRM are not the controlling CBRS boundaries adopted by Congress.  The official CBRS maps used to determine whether or not an area is located within the CBRS are available for download at http://www.fws.gov.  An official determination of whether or not an area is located within the CBRS can be obtained by contacting the FWS field office at the phone number shown on the body of the FIRM panel.

		<overview>
			<eaover>
The DFIRM Database is made up of several data themes containing both spatial and attribute information.
These data together represent the current flood risk for the subject area as identified by FEMA. The
attribute tables include SFHA locations, flood zone designations, BFEs, political entities, cross-section
locations, FIRM panel information, and other data related to the NFIP.
			</eaover>
			<eadetcit>Appendix L of FEMA&apos;s Guidelines and Specifications for FEMA Flood Hazard Mapping Partners contains a detailed description of each attribute code and a reference to other relevant information.</eadetcit>
			<eadetcit>The following tables are included in this data set: l_comm_info l_pan_revis l_pol_fhbm l_stn_start s_base_index s_bfe s_cbrs s_cst_tsct_ln s_firm_pan s_fld_haz_ar s_fld_haz_ln s_gen_struct s_label_ld s_label_pt s_limwa s_perm_bmk s_pol_ar s_pol_ln s_quad_index s_wtr_ar s_wtr_ln s_xs study_info</eadetcit>
